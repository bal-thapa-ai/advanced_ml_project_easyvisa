# 🛂 EasyVisa – Advanced Machine Learning Project  

## 📌 Overview  
The EasyVisa project applies **advanced machine learning techniques** to support the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) in streamlining visa certification decisions. With the rising volume of applications, the goal is to automate candidate shortlisting and provide data-driven recommendations for visa approvals.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Predict whether a visa applicant will be certified or denied  
- Identify significant drivers influencing visa approval  
- Provide recommendations for improving decision-making efficiency

## 📂 Dataset  
⚠️ *Dataset not included due to university policy*  
- Notebook is structured to run with a CSV dataset (`visa_data.csv`)  
- A synthetic dataset with the same schema can be used for demo purposes

## 🛠️ Tech Stack / Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy / Pandas** – data manipulation & analysis  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models & preprocessing  
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)** – handling class imbalance  
- **XGBoost** – advanced boosting classifier

## 📊 Key Steps  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovered trends across regions, wages, and education  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned, encoded, and prepared features for modeling  
3. **Model Building:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, XGBoost  
4. **Model Tuning:** Hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation for top models  
5. **Evaluation:** Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrices  
6. **Business Insights:** Identified education, wage, and job requirements as key approval drivers
